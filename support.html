<h1>Phocrack – Support & Help Center</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 24, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to the official Phocrack support page. We’re here to help you get the most out of your AI math & physics solver.</p>

<h2>Quick Solutions to Common Issues</h2>

<h3>The app doesn’t recognize my handwritten problem</h3>
<p>- Write clearly and on a plain background<br>
- Make sure the entire problem is inside the camera frame<br>
- Use good lighting and avoid shadows<br>
- Try increasing contrast or writing with a darker pen</p>

<h3>The solution is wrong or incomplete</h3>
<p>- Some very advanced or poorly scanned problems may confuse the AI<br>
- Try re-taking the photo or typing the problem manually<br>
- You can always report incorrect solutions directly in the app (tap the “Report Issue” button on the solution screen)</p>

<h3>The app is slow or crashes</h3>
<p>- Close background apps and restart Phocrack<br>
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection (required only for AI processing)<br>
- Update to the latest version from the App Store<br>
- Restart your device</p>

<h3>No internet connection message</h3>
<p>Phocrack needs internet only when sending the image to our AI servers. Solution history and previously solved problems work fully offline.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>Is Phocrack free?</h3>
<p>Yes – core features are completely free. Optional premium features may be added in future updates.</p>

<h3>Do you store my problems or photos?</h3>
<p>No. Images are deleted from our servers within seconds after processing. Only you keep a local history on your device (which you can delete anytime).</p>

<h3>Can I use Phocrack offline?</h3>
<p>You need internet only when solving a new problem. All previously solved problems are available offline.</p>

<h3>Does it work with handwritten notes?</h3>
<p>Yes – Phocrack excels at reading clear handwriting in math and physics.</p>

<h3>Which topics are supported?</h3>
<p>Everything from middle-school arithmetic to university-level calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, thermodynamics, and more.</p>

<h3>Can I delete my history?</h3>
<p>Yes – go to Settings → Clear History or delete individual solutions.</p>
