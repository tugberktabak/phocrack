<p>Thank you for using Phocrack. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your information when you use Phocrack – AI Math Solver & Physics Solver (the “App”).</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

<h3>a) Information You Provide Directly</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Photos or images of math, geometry, or physics problems that you upload or capture using the camera</li>
    <li>Text you manually type into the App</li>
    <li>Any feedback or messages you send us through the App (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>b) Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Device information (device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers)</li>
    <li>App usage data (which features you use, frequency, crash reports, performance logs)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (only if you grant location permission, used solely for analytics)</li>
</ul>

<h3>c) Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We do NOT require you to create an account or log in</li>

    <li>We do NOT access your photo library beyond the single image you choose to analyze</li>
    <li>We do NOT use third-party analytics or advertising trackers</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>The images and text you submit are used solely to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Process the math/physics problem using our AI models</li>
    <li>Generate and display the step-by-step solution</li>
    <li>Improve the accuracy and performance of our AI models (anonymized and aggregated)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anonymous usage statistics help us understand which topics are most difficult for students and prioritize future improvements.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>

<h3>Supabase (supabase.com)</h3>

    <li>Only anonymized, aggregated metrics are transmitted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fal.ai (fal.ai)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provides the core AI vision and reasoning models that solve your math and physics problems</li>
    <li>Images you upload are sent to fal.ai servers for processing</li>
    <li>fal.ai processes the image, extracts the mathematical content, and returns the solution</li>
    <li>fal.ai states that they do not store your images permanently and deletes them shortly after processing</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Solved problems are stored locally on your device only (in your solution history)</li>
